I just have a weird bug that I cannot handle. After increasing hearts or making a bid if you turn back to Artwork List page it does not update the Likes or Bids count. But if you refresh the page it also refreshes the likes and bid counts on Artwork List page. I try to debug a bit and I see that my database get"/" method turns true in the first request but than it turns empty. If you can show me how to fix this I will really appreciate.

This assignment was really helpful for me to upgrade my bugging skills. I try to apply "go with the flow" approach and it was really easy to figure things out (except that wierd bug :D).
